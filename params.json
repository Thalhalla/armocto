You must get into the Container, login as the steam user and incant `/home/steam/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh`,\r\nthen at the steam prompt type `login $STEAM_USER $STEAM_PASSWORD` with the steam credentials for your dedicated server account \r\n(it is recommended you make a separate account for each dedicated server you put up)\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a good way to automate this process.  Perhaps, just configure the entire steam folder externally with the guard tokens and all, I’m not certain how portable that directory is going to be after all that is configured.\r\n\r\nAt this point you will have to do the dance to get the steam token.\r\n\r\nAnd to make all this persistent you’ll need to -v mount at least the steam directories, but I’ve just been mounting the entire /home/steam directory so I can save maps and other things out as well YMMV\r\n\r\nsaving the directory before migrating to octohost can be a tricky step.  Essentially I run `make run` on this project:\r\nhttp://thalhalla.github.io/dockarmaiii/\r\nand copy the home directory out at that time.  Then copy over to my octohost into the `/exports/armocto` directory\r\n","google":"UA-63021030-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
